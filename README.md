# SmartRacks 
This is the project I did for the Walmart Hackathon 2021. This solution is meant to help with Supply Chain Management. 
<br> The shelves in a store or a warehouse are equipped to weigh the products placed on it and estimate the number of items on it. On linking this with a database, 
the employees can be alerted to restock the shelf.
<br> On configuring the shelf to let it know what product it is holding, it will be able to weigh the items and calculate the total number of items on it. 
This data will be sent to the database (Firebase) which will be linked to a mobile (Flutter) as well as a web (ReactJS) app using which the employees will be alerted to restock the shelf.

### Weighing Scale tech used
Arduino Uno
<br> Load Cell â€“ 5KG
